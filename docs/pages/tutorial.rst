Click this button above to start a tutorial in a jupyter notebook on
[binder](https://mybinder.org) without the need to install anything to your
computer.

If you want to try things locally on your laptop:
install `TimeEvolvingMPO` by following the instructions at :ref:`install-label`.


Say hi!
-------

The TEMPO library is currently under construction. This example serves merely
as a placeholder for the tutorial to come. However, you can check that you can
access the (almost) empty library by executing the `tempo.say_hi()` example
below.


Open a interactive python3 session and type:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> import time_evolving_mpo as tempo
  >>> tempo.say_hi()

This should give you the following message:

.. code-block:: none

  Hi there!
  This is TimeEvolvingMPO version 0.0.0 speaking!
